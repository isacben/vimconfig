# My vim configuration files

This repository contains my configuration files for the vim editor. In this README document, I also document some vim commands I want to remember.

## Installation

### Option 1: Clonning the repository

1. Clone the repository
2. Add a symbolic link to the configuration files (for example, the `.vimcr` file). The symbolic link should be in the user's home directory:

```
cd ~
ln -s /path/to/repo/.vimcr .vimcr
```

### Option 2: Download the configuration files

If you don't want to clone the repo, just download the configuration files, for example the .vimcr file, and put it in your user's home directory.
